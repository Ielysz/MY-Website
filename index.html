                <p><b>Ethiopia is widely considered to be the epicentre of where coffee came from. If you’ve ever googled “coffee history”, you will have come across the famous story of how coffee was founded in Ethiopia by Kaldi, an Ethiopian goat herder, around 800 AD.

                    He wandered over to his goats to see them acting very strangely. They were energised and excited after eating some berries from a tree. After trying the berries himself, and also feeling excitable and alert, Kaldi took these berries to a monk.
                    
                    The monks exclaimed that it was the work of the devil and threw the berries into the fire. In doing so, a beautiful, heavenly aroma was released and the berries were quickly raked from the fire and crushed into embers. Realising their mistake, the berries were then placed into a jug and covered with hot water for preservation.
                    
                    The monks then went on to drink this lovely new concoction, only to realise it helped them stay awake during nightly devotions and prayers.
                    
                    Of course, this is probably just a wonderful legend and the history of coffee is more likely to lie with the Oromo/Galla people, from a nomadic tribe.</p></b></div>
                <h2>Or does coffee history begin in Yemen?</h2>
               
            <div class="logo1">
                <img src="yemen.jpg.png">
                <p><b>There are also a few well-known stories about Yemen’s contribution in the founding of coffee. The most famous legend from Yemen about coffee origins has a slight twist on the Ethiopian story.

                    A Yemenite Sufi mystic was traveling through Ethiopia on spiritual matters. He encountered some very energetic and enthusiastic birds that had been eating the fruit off a plant, which is now known as the coffee plant. Exhausted from his journey, he decided to try these berries for himself and he found that they produced an energetic state in him as well.
                    
                    However, it’s largely believed that coffee beans were originally exported from Ethiopia to Yemen. Later, Yemeni traders brought coffee plants back to their homeland and began to grow them there.</p></b></div>
              
                    <h2>The word quickly spread</h2>
            <div class="logo2">
                <img src="world.jpg.png">
                <p><b>As it’s thought that coffee originated in Ethiopia, it’s also believed it made its way north, across the red sea into Yemen in the 15th Century. It then started to be grown here in the Yemeni district of Arabia, and by the 16th century it was known in Persia, Egypt, Syria, and Turkey.

                    It was immensely popular for its qualities to help improve alertness and wakefulness, allowing people to devote more time to spiritual matters and praying.
                    
                    The world’s first coffee house was opened in Constantinople in 1475, now known as Istanbul. Coffee was drunk at home as part of the daily routine, as well as to show hospitality to guests. Outside of the home, people visited coffee houses to not only drink coffee but to engage in conversation, listen to music, watch performers, play chess, gossip and catch up on news. Without the modern technologies we have today, coffee houses quickly became the epicentre for exchanging and gaining information. They were often referred to as “Schools of the Wise.”
                    
                    And with thousands of pilgrims visiting Mecca each year from all over the world, knowledge of this “wine of Araby”, which it quickly became referred to, began to spread.</p></b></div>
